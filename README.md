The Odin Project - Recipe HTML Project

This is the first project in The Odin Project's fooundations course.  It is a demonstration of what
I have learned in the HTML Foundations section of the course.  The website will consist of a few pages
with links to few recipes.  

Some of the HTML concepts used are headings, links, images, lists (ordered and unordered), and multi-page organization. Since I haven't learned CSS, it isn't too pretty!
