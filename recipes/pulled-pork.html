  <p>The reason I call this smoked pulled pork butt “simple” is because of how little effort it takes. This recipe doesn’t require any fancy injections, tools, spritzing concoctions, or wrapping to have it come out absolutely perfect every. single. time. All you need to make this recipe a success is a good pork shoulder, my famous homemade sweet BBQ rub, good smoke, and plenty of time.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 8-10 pound bone-in pork shoulder roast (AKA Boston butt)</li>
    <li>2-3 Tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
    <li>¼ cup Signature Sweet Rub (link in recipe notes)</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Signature Sweet Rub (for later use)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the smoker.</strong> Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees F for indirect smoking. I recommend hickory or apple for this recipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Prep the meat.</strong> Remove your roast from the packaging and wipe it down on all sides with paper towels, cleaning off any small bone fragments or extra liquid on the exterior.</li>
    <li><strong>Slather the pork butt in mustard.</strong> Slather the entire exterior of the pork shoulder with the yellow mustard.</li>
    <li><strong>Season with Sweet Rub.</strong> Season your pork roast on all sides, top and bottom, with the Homemade BBQ Sweet Rub. Don't worry about rubbing the seasoning into the meat, just be sure it is liberally coated all over.</li>
    <li><strong>Smoke the pork butt.</strong> Place your seasoned roast on the smoker fat side up, preferably in the middle of the grate avoiding any direct hot spots. Close the lid and smoke the pork until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 195 degrees F. You can cook to 201 degrees F if you like softer pork. This process can take anywhere between 15-20 hours, depending on the consistency of heat in your smoker and the size of your pork shoulder.</li>
    <li><strong>Wrap and rest the meat.</strong> Remove the pork shoulder from the smoker and wrap tightly in foil. Allow the roast to rest for at least an hour before shredding.</li>
    <li><strong>Shred and serve.</strong> Pull apart the shoulder, discarding any chunks of fat or gristle. Sprinkle the roast with an additional tablespoon or so of the Homemade Sweet BBQ Rub. Serve and enjoy!</li>
