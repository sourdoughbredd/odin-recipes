    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Smoked beef ribs are the newest (and most glorious) meat trend to hit the BBQ scene. These mammoth mouthfuls of meat adorn the best BBQ platters with a hefty bit of beef packed with delicious flavor.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4-bone section beef ribs (about 4-5 pounds)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Dijon mustard with horseradish</li>
      <li>6 tbsp beef rub (equa parts salt, pepper, and garlic powder)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Preheat the smoker.</strong> Preheat your smoker to 250 degrees F for indirect cooking. Use a hardwood, like oak or hickory, to generate the best smoke for these ribs.</li>
      <li><strong>Season.</strong> Slather your ribs with the Dijon mustard. Season liberally on all sides with Beef Rub, or the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. </li>
      <li><strong>Smoke the ribs.</strong> Place your ribs on the smoker and insert the meat thermometer probe in the thickest part of the meat (without touching the bone). Program your thermometer alert to sound at 203 degrees F. Close the lid, and smoke the ribs for 3 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Spritz the beef ribs and continue smoking.</strong> In a food safe spray bottle, shake the vinegar and hot sauce together. After the initial 3 hour smoke, begin spritzing your ribs every 45 minutes to an hour. Continue smoking until the ribs have reached an internal temperature of 203 degrees F. This process typically takes between 8-10 hours, but every rack is a little different.</li>
      <li><strong>Rest, slice, and serve.</strong> Remove the ribs from the smoker, wrap in foil, butcher paper, or unwaxed parchment paper and let rest in an insulated cooler for at least an hour before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
